## Branching Strategy
- **main**: Stable, production-ready code

## CI/CD Pipeline
- **Build**: Lint, format, and build code on every push
- **Test**: Run unit and integration tests
- **Deploy**: Automated deployment to staging/production
- **Code Quality**: Enforce standards with ESLint, Prettier, etc.

## Code Review Process
- All changes require pull requests
- At least one approval before merging
- Automated checks must pass
- Use issue and PR templates for consistency

## Issue Management
- Use GitHub Issues for bugs, features, and tasks
- Label issues for priority and type
